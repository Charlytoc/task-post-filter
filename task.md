<!-- To see this in the preview mode with VSCode just press ctrl + shift + v -->

## Objective:
Create a React application that fetches dummy data from 'https://dummyjson.com/posts' and displays a list of posts. Implement a filter functionality that allows users to search and filter the posts based on the post title. For example, get the posts which title starts with 'a' for 'music', that kinds of filter.

## Requirements:

- Create a React application using the provided repository with an empty app.
- Fetch the dummy data from 'https://dummyjson.com/posts' using an HTTP request.
- Display the fetched posts in a list view. Each post should include at least the following information: title, author, and content.
- Implement a search/filter functionality that allows users to filter the displayed posts based on the post title.
- The search/filter should update the displayed posts in real-time as the user types in the search input field.
- Display a message if no posts match the search criteria.
- Ensure that the app is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
- Write clean and maintainable code with appropriate comments and documentation.
- Use modern React best practices and appropriate libraries or tools as needed.
- Commit your changes to the repository and provide a clear README.md file with instructions on how to run the app locally.


## Evaluation Criteria:
Your implementation will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Code organization and structure.
- Proper use of React components, state, and props.
- Correct implementation of the post filtering functionality.
- User interface design and responsiveness.
- Code readability and documentation.
- Proper error handling and edge case considerations.
